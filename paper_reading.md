## 1. ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (AlexNet)

**Motivation:**

Traditional neural networks struggled with large-scale image classification due to computational limitations and overfitting issues. The availability of large datasets like ImageNet and powerful GPUs created an opportunity to train much deeper and more complex convolutional neural networks. The authors aimed to demonstrate that deep CNNs could achieve breakthrough performance on challenging image recognition tasks.

**Method:**

The architecture consists of 5 convolutional layers followed by 3 fully-connected layers, with ReLU activation functions throughout. Key innovations include: using ReLU instead of tanh/sigmoid for faster training, training on multiple GPUs with a novel parallelization scheme, using local response normalization, overlapping pooling, and extensive data augmentation. Dropout was applied in the fully-connected layers to reduce overfitting. The network was trained using stochastic gradient descent with momentum.

**Results:**

Achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0% respectively on ILSVRC-2010, substantially better than previous best results. On ILSVRC-2012, achieved 15.3% top-5 error rate with an ensemble of models. The network demonstrated that depth was crucial for good performance, and that the learned features were highly transferable to other vision tasks.

**Limitations and possible future work:**

The network required significant computational resources and training time. The authors suggested that even larger networks with more data could achieve better performance. They noted that unsupervised pre-training might help when labeled data is limited, and that the architecture could be improved with better regularization techniques and optimization methods.

## 2. An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale (Vision Transformer)

**Motivation:**

Convolutional neural networks dominated computer vision but had limitations in capturing global information due to their focus on local features. The Transformer architecture achieved great success in natural language processing through its self-attention mechanism that effectively captures long-range dependencies. The authors aimed to apply pure Transformer architecture to image recognition to explore its potential in the visual domain.

**Method:**

Input images are divided into fixed-size patches, with each patch treated as a token to adapt to the Transformer structure. The processed image tokens are mapped to high-dimensional space through linear projection, then utilize Transformer components including positional encoding, multi-head self-attention, and feed-forward networks to capture long-range dependencies between all tokens. Classification is performed based on a special classification token. Large-scale datasets are used for pre-training, followed by fine-tuning on downstream tasks.

**Results:**

Vision Transformer achieved performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art CNN models on image classification datasets, with faster training speed than ResNet. A key observation was that ViT excelled on large-scale datasets but underperformed CNNs on small datasets, indicating high data requirements but potential advantages under large-scale training conditions. ViT demonstrated good transfer learning capabilities, especially under large-scale pre-training conditions.

**Limitations and possible future work:**

Transformer architecture has high computational complexity, especially the self-attention mechanism. Future work could explore more efficient attention mechanisms or sparsification methods. While Transformers excel at capturing global information, they may be inferior to CNNs for local, fine-grained feature extraction. Hybrid architectures combining CNN advantages could be considered, with applications to segmentation tasks requiring local information. Self-supervised training for ViT still lags behind supervised pre-training, warranting exploration of better self-supervised algorithms adapted to ViT structure.

## 3. Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition (ResNet)

**Motivation:**

As neural networks became deeper, a degradation problem emerged where accuracy saturated and then degraded rapidly, not due to overfitting but due to optimization difficulties. Traditional deep networks suffered from vanishing gradients and were hard to train. The authors hypothesized that it should be easier to optimize residual mappings than original unreferenced mappings, leading to the development of residual learning.

**Method:**

The core innovation is the residual block with shortcut connections that perform identity mapping. Instead of learning H(x), the network learns the residual function F(x) = H(x) - x, so the final output becomes F(x) + x. This formulation allows gradients to flow directly through shortcut connections. The architecture uses batch normalization, and the shortcuts can be either identity mappings or linear projections when dimensions change. The network can be extremely deep (up to 152 layers) while remaining trainable.

**Results:**

Achieved 3.57% ensemble error on ImageNet classification, winning ILSVRC 2015. Demonstrated that extremely deep networks (152 layers) could outperform shallower ones when residual connections were used. The 34-layer ResNet outperformed VGG-19 while being computationally more efficient. Results showed consistent improvements across different datasets including CIFAR-10 and PASCAL VOC, demonstrating the general applicability of residual learning.

**Limitations and possible future work:**

While residual connections solved the degradation problem, very deep networks still required careful initialization and training procedures. The theoretical understanding of why residual networks work so well remained incomplete. Future work could explore the optimization landscape of residual networks and develop even more efficient architectures. The authors suggested investigating different forms of residual functions and shortcut connections.

## 4. Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition (VGGNet)

**Motivation:**

Previous CNN architectures used relatively large filter sizes (7×7 or 11×11), but the impact of network depth with very small filters was not well understood. The authors aimed to systematically investigate how network depth affects performance in large-scale image recognition, hypothesizing that deeper networks with smaller filters could achieve better performance while using fewer parameters.

**Method:**

The architecture uses very small 3×3 convolutional filters throughout the entire network, with the rationale that a stack of small filters can achieve the same effective receptive field as larger filters while using fewer parameters and more non-linearities. The networks range from 11 to 19 layers deep (VGG-11 to VGG-19), with uniform architecture using only 3×3 convolutions and 2×2 max pooling. All hidden layers use ReLU activation, and the final layers are fully connected with softmax output.

**Results:**

Achieved 7.3% top-5 error rate on ImageNet with single-scale testing and 6.8% with multi-scale testing, securing 2nd place in ILSVRC-2014. VGG-19 demonstrated that increasing depth consistently improved performance. The learned features showed excellent transferability to other tasks and datasets. The simple and uniform architecture made it easy to implement and became widely adopted as a backbone for various computer vision tasks.

**Limitations and possible future work:**

The network required significant memory and computational resources, with VGG-19 having 144 million parameters. Training time was substantial, and the large number of parameters made the model prone to overfitting on smaller datasets. Future work could focus on reducing computational complexity while maintaining the benefits of depth, possibly through more efficient architectures or compression techniques.

## 5. Going Deeper with Convolutions (GoogLeNet/Inception)

**Motivation:**

Simply increasing network size leads to overfitting and increased computational cost. The authors aimed to design an efficient architecture that could go deeper while maintaining computational efficiency. They wanted to find the optimal local sparse structure that could be approximated by dense components, leading to both improved performance and computational efficiency.

**Method:**

The core innovation is the Inception module, which performs multiple convolution operations (1×1, 3×3, 5×5) and pooling in parallel, then concatenates the results. 1×1 convolutions are used for dimensionality reduction before expensive operations. The network is 22 layers deep but uses global average pooling instead of fully connected layers, significantly reducing parameters. Auxiliary classifiers are added at intermediate layers to help with gradient flow and provide regularization.

**Results:**

Achieved approximately 6.7% top-5 error rate on ImageNet, winning ILSVRC 2014. The network used 12× fewer parameters than AlexNet while achieving superior performance. Demonstrated that architectural innovations could be more effective than simply scaling up existing designs. The Inception modules showed that parallel processing of different scales could capture multi-scale features effectively.

**Limitations and possible future work:**

The architecture design required significant manual engineering and intuition. The choice of filter sizes and combinations in Inception modules was somewhat ad-hoc. Future work could explore automated architecture search methods and more principled ways to design efficient modules. The authors suggested investigating different combinations of operations and more sophisticated ways to handle multi-scale features.

## 6. You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection (YOLO)

**Motivation:**

Existing object detection systems used complex pipelines with multiple stages (region proposals, classification, post-processing), making them slow and hard to optimize end-to-end. The authors aimed to reframe object detection as a single regression problem, enabling real-time performance while maintaining competitive accuracy. They wanted a unified architecture that could be optimized globally.

**Method:**

YOLO divides the input image into an S×S grid, where each grid cell predicts B bounding boxes and confidence scores, plus C class probabilities. Each bounding box prediction includes x, y, width, height, and confidence. The confidence reflects both the probability of containing an object and the accuracy of the bounding box. The architecture uses a CNN backbone (similar to GoogLeNet) followed by fully connected layers for final predictions. Training uses a multi-part loss function combining localization and classification errors.

**Results:**

Achieved 45 FPS on real-time detection (155 FPS for Fast YOLO variant) while maintaining 63.4% mAP on PASCAL VOC. Demonstrated significantly better generalization to new domains compared to R-CNN variants. The unified architecture enabled end-to-end training and inference, making it much simpler than existing detection pipelines. Showed that real-time object detection was achievable without sacrificing too much accuracy.

**Limitations and possible future work:**

YOLO struggled with small objects and objects that appear in groups, due to the spatial constraints of the grid-based approach. Localization errors were more common than classification errors. The system had difficulty with objects of unusual aspect ratios. Future work could address these limitations through better architectures, multi-scale processing, or improved loss functions that better handle small objects and precise localization.

## 7. Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks (Faster R-CNN)

**Motivation:**

Fast R-CNN achieved good detection accuracy but was bottlenecked by the region proposal step, which relied on CPU-based algorithms like Selective Search that took 2 seconds per image. The authors aimed to eliminate this bottleneck by introducing a neural network-based region proposal method that could share computation with the detection network, enabling truly end-to-end training and faster inference.

**Method:**

The key innovation is the Region Proposal Network (RPN), a fully convolutional network that shares features with the detection network. RPN uses anchor boxes at multiple scales and aspect ratios at each spatial position to generate object proposals. The network has two main components: RPN for generating proposals and Fast R-CNN detector for final classification and refinement. Training alternates between RPN and detector, or uses approximate joint training where both networks share convolutional features.

**Results:**

Achieved 73.2% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2007, with 5 FPS inference speed. Region proposal time was reduced from 2 seconds (Selective Search) to 10 milliseconds. Demonstrated that neural network-based proposals could match or exceed the quality of traditional methods while being much faster. The shared convolutional features between RPN and detector improved both efficiency and accuracy.

**Limitations and possible future work:**

While much faster than previous methods, 5 FPS was still not real-time (30+ FPS) for many applications. The training procedure was complex, requiring alternating optimization or careful tuning of loss weights for joint training. The architecture was still relatively complex with multiple components. Future work could focus on simplifying the architecture, achieving true real-time performance, and improving small object detection capabilities.

## 8. Mask R-CNN (Mask R-CNN)

**Motivation:**

Instance segmentation is challenging because it requires both accurate object detection and precise pixel-level segmentation of each instance. Existing approaches either used complex multi-stage pipelines or suffered from systematic errors on overlapping instances. The authors aimed to develop a simple, flexible framework that could perform instance segmentation by extending Faster R-CNN with a mask prediction branch, enabling unified training for detection and segmentation.

**Method:**

Mask R-CNN extends Faster R-CNN by adding a third branch that outputs object masks in parallel with classification and bounding box regression. The key innovation is RoIAlign, which replaces RoIPool to eliminate quantization artifacts and preserve pixel-to-pixel alignment. The mask branch uses a small fully convolutional network (FCN) to predict binary masks for each class independently, using per-pixel sigmoid and binary cross-entropy loss. This decouples mask and class prediction, unlike semantic segmentation approaches that use softmax across classes.

**Results:**

Achieved 35.7% mask AP on COCO test-dev with ResNet-101-FPN, running at 5 FPS. Outperformed all previous state-of-the-art single-model results including FCIS+++. Also excelled on COCO object detection (39.8% box AP) and human pose estimation (63.1% keypoint AP). RoIAlign provided 10-50% relative improvement in mask accuracy. The framework demonstrated excellent generalizability across different instance-level recognition tasks.

**Limitations and possible future work:**

The method still required significant computational resources and was not real-time for many applications. The training procedure involved multiple loss functions that needed careful balancing. The approach relied on accurate bounding box detection as a prerequisite for good mask prediction. Future work could focus on achieving real-time performance, improving efficiency through architectural innovations, developing better training strategies for multi-task learning, and extending to video instance segmentation or 3D scenarios.

## 9. Fast R-CNN (Fast R-CNN)

**Motivation:**

R-CNN and SPPnet had significant drawbacks including multi-stage training pipelines, expensive feature extraction and storage requirements, and slow inference speeds. R-CNN performed a forward pass for each object proposal without sharing computation, while SPPnet couldn't update convolutional layers during fine-tuning. The authors aimed to develop a unified training algorithm that could jointly learn classification and bounding box regression while enabling end-to-end training of all network layers.

**Method:**

Fast R-CNN processes the entire image through convolutional layers to produce a feature map, then uses RoI pooling to extract fixed-length feature vectors for each object proposal. The network has two output branches: softmax classification over K+1 classes and bounding box regression offsets. Key innovations include hierarchical mini-batch sampling (N=2 images, R/N=64 RoIs per image), multi-task loss combining classification and regression, and single-stage training that jointly optimizes both tasks. The method uses smooth L1 loss for bounding box regression to handle outliers better than L2 loss.

**Results:**

Achieved 66% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2012, compared to 62% for R-CNN. Training was 9× faster than R-CNN and 3× faster than SPPnet, while testing was 213× faster than R-CNN and 10× faster than SPPnet. Detection took 0.3 seconds per image (excluding proposal generation time). Multi-task training improved classification accuracy by 0.8-1.1 mAP points compared to stage-wise training. The method enabled efficient evaluation of different design choices that were previously too expensive to test.

**Limitations and possible future work:**

The method still relied on external region proposal algorithms like Selective Search, which remained a computational bottleneck. While much faster than predecessors, inference speed was still not real-time for many applications. The approach required careful tuning of the multi-task loss balance parameter. Future work could focus on integrating proposal generation into the network, achieving real-time performance, and exploring the relationship between proposal quality and detection accuracy. The authors noted that sparse proposals appeared to work better than dense proposals, suggesting room for improvement in proposal generation strategies.

## 10. Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation (R-CNN)

**Motivation:**

Object detection performance had plateaued on PASCAL VOC dataset, with the best methods being complex ensemble systems combining multiple low-level features with high-level context. Traditional features like SIFT and HOG were limited to simple representations. The authors aimed to bridge the gap between image classification and object detection by applying high-capacity CNNs to object detection, addressing two key challenges: localizing objects with deep networks and training high-capacity models with limited annotated detection data.

**Method:**

R-CNN combines region proposals with CNN features. The method generates ~2000 category-independent region proposals using selective search, warps each proposal to a fixed 227×227 size, and extracts 4096-dimensional features using a CNN pre-trained on ImageNet. The approach uses supervised pre-training on ImageNet classification followed by domain-specific fine-tuning on detection data. For classification, class-specific linear SVMs are trained on CNN features using hard negative mining. The method treats regions with ≥0.5 IoU overlap with ground truth as positives during fine-tuning, but uses different thresholds (0.3 IoU) for SVM training.

**Results:**

Achieved 53.3% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2012, a 30% relative improvement over previous best results. On ILSVRC2013 detection, achieved 31.4% mAP compared to 24.3% for OverFeat. The method significantly outperformed traditional approaches using spatial pyramids and bag-of-visual-words (35.1% mAP). Demonstrated that CNN features were much more effective than hand-crafted features, and that supervised pre-training followed by fine-tuning was crucial for good performance with limited detection data.

**Limitations and possible future work:**

The method was computationally expensive, requiring forward passes through the CNN for each of ~2000 proposals per image, taking 47 seconds per image on GPU. Training was a complex multi-stage pipeline involving pre-training, fine-tuning, SVM training, and bounding box regression. The approach required significant storage for cached features (hundreds of gigabytes). Future work could focus on sharing computation across proposals, simplifying the training pipeline, and developing more efficient architectures. The authors suggested that the supervised pre-training paradigm would be effective for other data-scarce vision problems.
