Abstract

Deep residual networks were shown to be able to scale up to thousands of layers
and still have improving performance. However, each fraction of a percent of improved
accuracy costs nearly doubling the number of layers, and so training very deep resid-
ual networks has a problem of diminishing feature reuse, which makes these networks
very slow to train. To tackle these problems, in this paper we conduct a detailed exper-
imental study on the architecture of ResNet blocks, based on which we propose a novel
architecture where we decrease depth and increase width of residual networks. We call
the resulting network structures wide residual networks (WRNs) and show that these are
far superior over their commonly used thin and very deep counterparts. For example,
we demonstrate that even a simple 16-layer-deep wide residual network outperforms in
accuracy and efﬁciency all previous deep residual networks, including thousand-layer-
deep networks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on CIFAR, SVHN, COCO, and
signiﬁcant improvements on ImageNet. Our code and models are available at https:

Convolutional neural networks have seen a gradual increase of the number of layers in the
last few years, starting from AlexNet [16], VGG [26], Inception [30] to Residual [11] net-
works, corresponding to improvements in many image recognition tasks. The superiority
of deep networks has been spotted in several works in the recent years [3, 22]. However,
training deep neural networks has several difﬁculties, including exploding/vanishing gradi-
ents and degradation. Various techniques were suggested to enable training of deeper neural
networks, such as well-designed initialization strategies [1, 12], better optimizers [29], skip
connections [19, 23], knowledge transfer [4, 24] and layer-wise training [25].

The latest residual networks [11] had a large success winning ImageNet and COCO 2015
competition and achieving state-of-the-art in several benchmarks, including object classiﬁ-
cation on ImageNet and CIFAR, object detection and segmentation on PASCAL VOC and
MS COCO. Compared to Inception architectures they show better generalization, meaning
the features can be utilized in transfer learning with better efﬁciency. Also, follow-up work
showed that residual links speed up convergence of deep networks [31]. Recent follow-up
work explored the order of activations in residual networks, presenting identity mappings
in residual blocks [13] and improving training of very deep networks. Successful training
of very deep networks was also shown to be possible through the use of highway networks

Figure 1: Various residual blocks used in the paper. Batch normalization and ReLU precede
each convolution (omitted for clarity)

[28], which is an architecture that had been proposed prior to residual networks. The essen-
tial difference between residual and highway networks is that in the latter residual links are
gated and weights of these gates are learned.

Therefore, up to this point, the study of residual networks has focused mainly on the
order of activations inside a ResNet block and the depth of residual networks. In this work
we attempt to conduct an experimental study that goes beyond the above points. By doing
so, our goal is to explore a much richer set of network architectures of ResNet blocks and
thoroughly examine how several other different aspects besides the order of activations affect
performance. As we explain below, such an exploration of architectures has led to new
interesting ﬁndings with great practical importance concerning residual networks.

Width vs depth in residual networks. The problem of shallow vs deep networks has
been in discussion for a long time in machine learning [2, 18] with pointers to the circuit
complexity theory literature showing that shallow circuits can require exponentially more
components than deeper circuits. The authors of residual networks tried to make them as thin
as possible in favor of increasing their depth and having less parameters, and even introduced
a «bottleneck» block which makes ResNet blocks even thinner.

We note, however, that the residual block with identity mapping that allows to train
very deep networks is at the same time a weakness of residual networks. As gradient ﬂows
through the network there is nothing to force it to go through residual block weights and it
can avoid learning anything during training, so it is possible that there is either only a few
blocks that learn useful representations, or many blocks share very little information with
small contribution to the ﬁnal goal. This problem was formulated as diminishing feature
reuse in [28]. The authors of [14] tried to address this problem with the idea of randomly
disabling residual blocks during training. This method can be viewed as a special case of
dropout [27], where each residual block has an identity scalar weight on which dropout is
applied. The effectiveness of this approach proves the hypothesis above.

Motivated by the above observation, our work builds on top of [13] and tries to answer
the question of how wide deep residual networks should be and address the problem of train-
ing. In this context, we show that the widening of ResNet blocks (if done properly) provides
a much more effective way of improving performance of residual networks compared to in-
creasing their depth. In particular, we present wider deep residual networks that signiﬁcantly
improve over [13], having 50 times less layers and being more than 2 times faster. We call
the resulting network architectures wide residual networks. For instance, our wide 16-layer
deep network has the same accuracy as a 1000-layer thin deep network and a comparable
number of parameters, although being several times faster to train. This type of experiments

thus seem to indicate that the main power of deep residual networks is in residual blocks, and
that the effect of depth is supplementary. We note that one can train even better wide resid-
ual networks that have twice as many parameters (and more), which suggests that to further
improve performance by increasing depth of thin networks one needs to add thousands of
layers in this case.

Use of dropout in ResNet blocks. Dropout was ﬁrst introduced in [27] and then was
adopted by many successful architectures as [16, 26] etc. It was mostly applied on top layers
that had a large number of parameters to prevent feature coadaptation and overﬁtting. It was
then mainly substituted by batch normalization [15] which was introduced as a technique to
reduce internal covariate shift in neural network activations by normalizing them to have spe-
ciﬁc distribution. It also works as a regularizer and the authors experimentally showed that a
network with batch normalization achieves better accuracy than a network with dropout. In
our case, as widening of residual blocks results in an increase of the number of parameters,
we studied the effect of dropout to regularize training and prevent overﬁtting. Previously,
dropout in residual networks was studied in [13] with dropout being inserted in the identity
part of the block, and the authors showed negative effects of that. Instead, we argue here
that dropout should be inserted between convolutional layers. Experimental results on wide
residual networks show that this leads to consistent gains, yielding even new state-of-the-
art results (e.g., 16-layer-deep wide residual network with dropout achieves 1.64% error on
SVHN).

In summary, the contributions of this work are as follows:

• We present a detailed experimental study of residual network architectures that thor-

oughly examines several important aspects of ResNet block structure.

• We propose a novel widened architecture for ResNet blocks that allows for residual

networks with signiﬁcantly improved performance.

• We propose a new way of utilizing dropout within deep residual networks so as to

properly regularize them and prevent overﬁtting during training.

• Last, we show that our proposed ResNet architectures achieve state-of-the-art results
on several datasets dramatically improving accuracy and speed of residual networks.

2 Wide residual networks

Residual block with identity mapping can be represented by the following formula:

xl+1 = xl + F(xl, Wl)

(1)

where xl+1 and xl are input and output of the l-th unit in the network, F is a residual func-
tion and Wl are parameters of the block. Residual network consists of sequentially stacked
residual blocks.

In [13] residual networks consisted of two type of blocks:

• basic - with two consecutive 3 × 3 convolutions with batch normalization and ReLU

preceding convolution: conv3 × 3-conv3 × 3 Fig.1(a)

• bottleneck - with one 3 × 3 convolution surrounded by dimensionality reducing and
expanding 1 × 1 convolution layers: conv1 × 1-conv3 × 3-conv1 × 1 Fig.1(b)

Table 1: Structure of wide residual networks. Network width is determined by factor k.
Original architecture [13] is equivalent to k = 1. Groups of convolutions are shown in brack-
ets where N is a number of blocks in group, downsampling performed by the ﬁrst layers
in groups conv3 and conv4. Final classiﬁcation layer is omitted for clearance. In the
particular example shown, the network uses a ResNet block of type B(3, 3).

Compared to the original architecture [11] in [13] the order of batch normalization, ac-
tivation and convolution in residual block was changed from conv-BN-ReLU to BN-ReLU-
conv. As the latter was shown to train faster and achieve better results we don’t consider
the original version. Furthermore, so-called «bottleneck» blocks were initially used to make
blocks less computationally expensive to increase the number of layers. As we want to study
the effect of widening and «bottleneck» is used to make networks thinner we don’t consider
it too, focusing instead on «basic» residual architecture.

There are essentially three simple ways to increase representational power of residual

blocks:

• to add more convolutional layers per block

• to widen the convolutional layers by adding more feature planes

• to increase ﬁlter sizes in convolutional layers

As small ﬁlters were shown to be very effective in several works including [26, 31] we do
not consider using ﬁlters larger than 3×3. Let us also introduce two factors, deepening factor
l and widening factor k, where l is the number of convolutions in a block and k multiplies
the number of features in convolutional layers, thus the baseline «basic» block corresponds
to l = 2, k = 1. Figures 1(a) and 1(c) show schematic examples of «basic» and «basic-wide»
blocks respectively.

The general structure of our residual networks is illustrated in table 1: it consists of an
initial convolutional layer conv1 that is followed by 3 groups (each of size N) of residual
blocks conv2, conv3 and conv4, followed by average pooling and ﬁnal classiﬁcation
layer. The size of conv1 is ﬁxed in all of our experiments, while the introduced widen-
ing factor k scales the width of the residual blocks in the three groups conv2-4 (e.g., the
original «basic» architecture is equivalent to k = 1). We want to study the effect of represen-
tational power of residual block and, to that end, we perform and test several modiﬁcations
to the «basic» architecture, which are detailed in the following subsections.

2.1 Type of convolutions in residual block

Let B(M) denote residual block structure, where M is a list with the kernel sizes of the
convolutional layers in a block. For example, B(3, 1) denotes a residual block with 3 × 3 and
1 × 1 convolutional layers (we always assume square spatial kernels). Note that, as we do
not consider «bottleneck» blocks as explained earlier, the number of feature planes is always
kept the same across the block. We would like to answer the question of how important each
of the 3 × 3 convolutional layers of the «basic» residual architecture is and if they can be
substituted by a less computationally expensive 1 × 1 layer or even a combination of 1 × 1
and 3 × 3 convolutional layers, e.g., B(1, 3) or B(1, 3). This can increase or decrease the
representational power of the block. We thus experiment with the following combinations
(note that the last combination, i.e., B(3, 1, 1) is similar to effective Network-in-Network
[20] architecture):

1. B(3, 3) - original «basic» block
2. B(3, 1, 3) - with one extra 1 × 1 layer
3. B(1, 3, 1) - with the same dimensionality of all convolutions, «straightened» bottleneck
4. B(1, 3) - the network has alternating 1 × 1 - 3 × 3 convolutions everywhere
5. B(3, 1) - similar idea to the previous block
6. B(3, 1, 1) - Network-in-Network style block

2.2 Number of convolutional layers per residual block

We also experiment with the block deepening factor l to see how it affects performance. The
comparison has to be done among networks with the same number of parameters, so in this
case we need to build networks with different l and d (where d denotes the total number of
blocks) while ensuring that network complexity is kept roughly constant. This means, for
instance, that d should decrease whenever l increases.

2.3 Width of residual blocks

In addition to the above modiﬁcations, we experiment with the widening factor k of a block.
While the number of parameters increases linearly with l (the deepening factor) and d
(the number of ResNet blocks), number of parameters and computational complexity are
quadratic in k. However, it is more computationally effective to widen the layers than have
thousands of small kernels as GPU is much more efﬁcient in parallel computations on large
tensors, so we are interested in an optimal d to k ratio.

One argument for wider residual networks would be that almost all architectures before
residual networks, including the most successful Inception [30] and VGG [26], were much
wider compared to [13]. For example, residual networks WRN-22-8 and WRN-16-10 (see
next paragraph for explanation of this notation) are very similar in width, depth and number
of parameters to VGG architectures.

We further refer to original residual networks with k = 1 as «thin» and to networks with
k > 1 as «wide». In the rest of the paper we use the following notation: WRN-n-k denotes
a residual network that has a total number of convolutional layers n and a widening factor k
(for example, network with 40 layers and k = 2 times wider than original would be denoted
as WRN-40-2). Also, when applicable we append block type, e.g. WRN-40-2-B(3, 3).

2.4 Dropout in residual blocks

As widening increases the number of parameters we would like to study ways of regular-
ization. Residual networks already have batch normalization that provides a regularization
effect, however it requires heavy data augmentation, which we would like to avoid, and it’s
not always possible. We add a dropout layer into each residual block between convolutions
as shown in ﬁg. 1(d) and after ReLU to perturb batch normalization in the next residual
block and prevent it from overﬁtting. In very deep residual networks that should help deal
with diminishing feature reuse problem enforcing learning in different residual blocks.

3 Experimental results

For experiments we chose well-known CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN and ImageNet image
classiﬁcation datasets. CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets [17] consist of 32 × 32 color
images drawn from 10 and 100 classes split into 50,000 train and 10,000 test images. For data
augmentation we do horizontal ﬂips and take random crops from image padded by 4 pixels on
each side, ﬁlling missing pixels with reﬂections of original image. We don’t use heavy data
augmentation as proposed in [9]. SVHN is a dataset of Google’s Street View House Numbers
images and contains about 600,000 digit images, coming from a signiﬁcantly harder real
world problem. For experiments on SVHN we don’t do any image preprocessing, except
dividing images by 255 to provide them in [0,1] range as input. All of our experiments
except ImageNet are based on [13] architecture with pre-activation residual blocks and we
use it as baseline. For ImageNet, we ﬁnd that using pre-activation in networks with less
than 100 layers does not make any signiﬁcant difference and so we decide to use the original
ResNet architecture in this case. Unless mentioned otherwise, for CIFAR we follow the
image preprocessing of [8] with ZCA whitening. However, for some CIFAR experiments
we instead use simple mean/std normalization such that we can directly compare with [13]
and other ResNet related works that make use of this type of preprocessing.

In the following we describe our ﬁndings w.r.t. the different ResNet block architectures
and also analyze the performance of our proposed wide residual networks. We note that for
all experiments related to «type of convolutions in a block» and «number of convolutions
per block» we use k = 2 and reduced depth compared to [13] in order to speed up training.

Type of convolutions in a block

We start by reporting results using trained networks with different block types B (reported
results are on CIFAR-10). We used WRN-40-2 for blocks B(1, 3, 1), B(3, 1), B(1, 3) and
B(3, 1, 1) as these blocks have only one 3 × 3 convolution. To keep the number of parameters
comparable we trained other networks with less layers: WRN-28-2-B(3, 3) and WRN-22-2-
B(3, 1, 3). We provide the results including test accuracy in median over 5 runs and time per
training epoch in the table 2. Block B(3, 3) turned out to be the best by a little margin, and
B(3, 1) with B(3, 1, 3) are very close to B(3, 3) in accuracy having less parameters and less
layers. B(3, 1, 3) is faster than others by a small margin.

Based on the above, blocks with comparable number of parameters turned out to give
more or less the same results. Due to this fact, we hereafter restrict our attention to only
WRNs with 3 × 3 convolutions so as to be also consistent with other methods.

Number of convolutions per block

We next proceed with the experiments related to varying the deepening factor l (which rep-
resents the number of convolutional layers per block). We show indicative results in table 3,
where in this case we took WRN-40-2 with 3 × 3 convolutions and trained several networks
with different deepening factor l ∈ [1, 2, 3, 4], same number of parameters (2.2×106) and
same number of convolutional layers.

As can be noticed, B(3, 3) turned out to be the best, whereas B(3, 3, 3) and B(3, 3, 3, 3)
had the worst performance. We speculate that this is probably due to the increased difﬁculty
in optimization as a result of the decreased number of residual connections in the last two
cases. Furthermore, B(3) turned out to be quite worse. The conclusion is that B(3, 3) is
optimal in terms of number of convolutions per block. For this reason, in the remaining
experiments we only consider wide residual networks with a block of type B(3, 3).

Width of residual blocks

As we try to increase widening parameter k we have to decrease total number of layers. To
ﬁnd an optimal ratio we experimented with k from 2 to 12 and depth from 16 to 40. The
results are presented in table 4. As can be seen, all networks with 40, 22 and 16 layers see
consistent gains when width is increased by 1 to 12 times. On the other hand, when keeping
the same ﬁxed widening factor k = 8 or k = 10 and varying depth from 16 to 28 there is a
consistent improvement, however when we further increase depth to 40 accuracy decreases
(e.g., WRN-40-8 loses in accuracy to WRN-22-8).

We show additional results in table 5 where we compare thin and wide residual networks.
As can be observed, wide WRN-40-4 compares favorably to thin ResNet-1001 as it achieves
better accuracy on both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Yet, it is interesting that these networks
have comparable number of parameters, 8.9×106 and 10.2×106, suggesting that depth does
not add regularization effects compared to width at this level. As we show further in bench-
marks, WRN-40-4 is 8 times faster to train, so evidently depth to width ratio in the original
thin residual networks is far from optimal.

Also, wide WRN-28-10 outperforms thin ResNet-1001 by 0.92% (with the same mini-
batch size during training) on CIFAR-10 and 3.46% on CIFAR-100, having 36 times less
layers (see table 5). We note that the result of 4.64% with ResNet-1001 was obtained with
batch size 64, whereas we use a batch size 128 in all of our experiments (i.e., all other results

Despite previous arguments that depth gives regularization effects and width causes net-
work to overﬁt, we successfully train networks with several times more parameters than
ResNet-1001. For instance, wide WRN-28-10 (table 5) and wide WRN-40-10 (table 9) have
respectively 3.6 and 5 times more parameters than ResNet-1001 and both outperform it by a
signiﬁcant margin.

and establishing a new state-of-the-art result on this dataset.

To summarize:

• widening consistently improves performance across residual networks of different

depth;

• increasing both depth and width helps until the number of parameters becomes too

high and stronger regularization is needed;

• there doesn’t seem to be a regularization effect from very high depth in residual net-
works as wide networks with the same number of parameters as thin ones can learn
same or better representations. Furthermore, wide networks can successfully learn
with a 2 or more times larger number of parameters than thin ones, which would re-
quire doubling the depth of thin networks, making them infeasibly expensive to train.

Dropout in residual blocks

We trained networks with dropout inserted into residual block between convolutions on all
datasets. We used cross-validation to determine dropout probability values, 0.3 on CIFAR
and 0.4 on SVHN. Also, we didn’t have to increase number of training epochs compared to
baseline networks without dropout.

Dropout decreases test error on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 by 0.11% and 0.4% corren-
spondingly (over median of 5 runs and mean/std preprocessing) with WRN-28-10, and gives
improvements with other ResNets as well (table 6). To our knowledge, that was the ﬁrst
result to approach 20% error on CIFAR-100, even outperforming methods with heavy data
augmentation. There is only a slight drop in accuracy with WRN-16-4 on CIFAR-10 which
we speculate is due to the relatively small number of parameters.

We notice a disturbing effect in residual network training after the ﬁrst learning rate drop
when both loss and validation error suddenly start to go up and oscillate on high values until
the next learning rate drop. We found out that it is caused by weight decay, however making
it lower leads to a signiﬁcant drop in accuracy. Interestingly, dropout partially removes this
effect in most cases, see ﬁgures 2, 3.

The effect of dropout becomes more evident on SVHN. This is probably due to the fact
that we don’t do any data augmentation and batch normalization overﬁts, so dropout adds

a regularization effect. Evidence for this can be found on training curves in ﬁgure 3 where
the loss without dropout drops to very low values. The results are presented in table 6. We
observe signiﬁcant improvements from using dropout on both thin and wide networks. Thin
50-layer deep network even outperforms thin 152-layer deep network with stochastic depth
[14]. We additionally trained WRN-16-8 with dropout on SVHN (table 9), which achieves
1.54% on SVHN - the best published result to our knowledge. Without dropout it achieves
1.81%.

Overall, despite the arguments of combining with batch normalization, dropout shows
itself as an effective techique of regularization of thin and wide networks. It can be used to
further improve results from widening, while also being complementary to it.

ImageNet and COCO experiments

For ImageNet we ﬁrst experiment with non-bottleneck ResNet-18 and ResNet-34, trying to
gradually increase their width from 1.0 to 3.0. The results are shown in table 7. Increas-
ing width gradually increases accuracy of both networks, and networks with a comparable
number of parameters achieve similar results, despite having different depth. Althouth these
networks have a large number of parameters, they are outperfomed by bottleneck networks,
which is probably either due to that bottleneck architecture is simply better suited for Ima-
geNet classiﬁcation task, or due to that this more complex task needs a deeper network. To
test this, we took the ResNet-50, and tried to make it wider by increasing inner 3 × 3 layer
width. With widening factor of 2.0 the resulting WRN-50-2-bottleneck outperforms ResNet-
152 having 3 times less layers, and being signiﬁcantly faster. WRN-50-2-bottleneck is only

slightly worse and almost 2× faster than the best-performing pre-activation ResNet-200, al-
thouth having slightly more parameters (table 8). In general, we ﬁnd that, unlike CIFAR,
ImageNet networks need more width at the same depth to achieve the same accuracy. It is
however clear that it is unnecessary to have residual networks with more than 50 layers due
to computational reasons.

We didn’t try to train bigger bottleneck networks as 8-GPU machines are needed for that.

We also used WRN-34-2 to participate in COCO 2016 object detection challenge, using
a combination of MultiPathNet [32] and LocNet [7]. Despite having only 34 layers, this
model achieves state-of-the-art single model performance, outperforming even ResNet-152
and Inception-v4-based models.

Finally, in table 9 we summarize our best WRN results over various commonly used

datasets.

for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and COCO (using non-ensemble models).

Computational efﬁciency

Thin and deep residual networks with small kernels are against the nature of GPU com-
putations because of their sequential structure. Increasing width helps effectively balance

computations in much more optimal way, so that wide networks are many times more ef-
ﬁcient than thin ones as our benchmarks show. We use cudnn v5 and Titan X to measure
forward+backward update times with minibatch size 32 for several networks, the results are
in the ﬁgure 4. We show that our best CIFAR wide WRN-28-10 is 1.6 times faster than thin
ResNet-1001. Furthermore, wide WRN-40-4, which has approximately the same accuracy
as ResNet-1001, is 8 times faster.

Figure 4: Time of forward+backward update per minibatch of size 32 for wide and thin
networks(x-axis denotes network depth and widening factor). Numbers beside bars indicate
test error on CIFAR-10, on top - time (ms). Test time is a proportional fraction of these
benchmarks. Note, for instance, that wide WRN-40-4 is 8 times faster than thin ResNet-
1001 while having approximately the same accuracy.

Implementation details

In all our experiments we use SGD with Nesterov momentum and cross-entropy loss. The
initial learning rate is set to 0.1, weight decay to 0.0005, dampening to 0, momentum to 0.9
and minibatch size to 128. On CIFAR learning rate dropped by 0.2 at 60, 120 and 160 epochs
and we train for total 200 epochs. On SVHN initial learning rate is set to 0.01 and we drop
it at 80 and 120 epochs by 0.1, training for total 160 epochs. Our implementation is based
on Torch [6]. We use [21] to reduce memory footprints of all our networks. For ImageNet
experiments we used fb.resnet.torch implementation [10]. Our code and models are
available at https://github.com/szagoruyko/wide-residual-networks.

4 Conclusions

We presented a study on the width of residual networks as well as on the use of dropout
in residual architectures. Based on this study, we proposed a wide residual network archi-
tecture that provides state-of-the-art results on several commonly used benchmark datasets
(including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN and COCO), as well as signiﬁcant improvements
on ImageNet. We demonstrate that wide networks with only 16 layers can signiﬁcantly out-
perform 1000-layer deep networks on CIFAR, as well as that 50-layer outperform 152-layer
on ImageNet, thus showing that the main power of residual networks is in residual blocks,
and not in extreme depth as claimed earlier. Also, wide residual networks are several times
faster to train. We think that these intriguing ﬁndings will help further advances in research
in deep neural networks.
